# Transaction-Managment-System
(Class: Software Methodology) - Partner Project

Processes simple banking transactions such as opening or closing an account, withdrawing or depositing to and from an account, and listing out the account database through the console.
Implemented inheritance with an abstract Account class and Savings, Checkings, and MoneyMarket subclasses. Used JUnit to test certain methods, created a Javadoc, and drew a class diagram.
